<p align=center >My Name is Sankalp R</p>
<p align=center>I am a Student at IIT Kharagpur</p>
<p align=center>Since the beginning of high school, I have become interested in biomedical engineering, pharmaceuticals, and the startup ecosystem. I am interested in projects, inventions, and areas where business and science coexist to help further our world.I've represented the United States at the International Geography Olympiad, co-founded Boston's first 24 hour high school hackathon, worked in labs at leading Ivy League Universities, and ran my own educational technology startup. Moving forward, I hope to use the skills I have acquired towards entrepreneurial endeavors in the medical field.</p>

<h2 align=center >Game of Thrones</h2>
<p align=center >Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled A Game of Thrones. It is filmed at Titanic Studios in Belfast and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, as well as in Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Spain, Scotland, and the United States. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its sixth season concluded on June 26, 2016. The series was renewed for a seventh season, which is scheduled to premiere in mid-2017 with a total of seven episodes. The series will conclude with its eighth season in 2018.

The series is set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and interweaves several plot lines with a large ensemble cast. The first narrative arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from it; the second covers the attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the rising threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.</p>
<h2 align=center >Karate Shotokon</h2>
<p align=center >Shotokan is a style of karate, developed from various martial arts by Gichin Funakoshi (1868–1957) and his son Gigo (Yoshitaka) Funakoshi (1906–1945). Gichin was born in Okinawa and is widely credited with popularizing "karate do" through a series of public demonstrations, and by promoting the development of university karate clubs, including those at Keio, Waseda, Hitotsubashi (Shodai), Takushoku, Chuo, Gakushuin, and Hosei.

Funakoshi had many students at the university clubs and outside dojos, who continued to teach karate after his death in 1957. However, internal disagreements (in particular the notion that competition is contrary to the essence of karate) led to the creation of different organisations—including an initial split between the Japan Karate Association (headed by Masatoshi Nakayama) and the Shotokai (headed by Motonobu Hironishi and Shigeru Egami), followed by many others—so that today there is no single "Shotokan school", although they all bear Funakoshi's influence.

As the most widely practiced style, Shotokan is considered a traditional and influential form of karate do.</p>
